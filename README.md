# scrabble_score_keeper
Python app that tracks players' scores in a game of Scrabble.

## thoughts for the future:
I'd like to add a bit more functionality, such as telling the app how many players there are and setting up player names.
Also, add a way to input the word played, so the score can be calculated rather than having all the info preset.
